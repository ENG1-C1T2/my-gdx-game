# my-gdx-game

I used the libGDX to generate a new project and this is it. See if you can get it working on your computer?

I followed [this guide](https://libgdx.com/dev/setup/).

## Dependencies

- An IDE - I used IntelliJ.
- JDK 8 (Higher JDK versions don't seem to work).
- Android SDK.

## To run:

### IntelliJ

Run the desktop:run configuration in the Gradle tool window.

### Command Line

```
./gradlew desktop:run
```
